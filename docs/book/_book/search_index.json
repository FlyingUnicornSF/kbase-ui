However, it is best to keep them always at the most recent version by updating your tool stack periodically.\n\nYou may have noticed that there are no Javascript tools above, such as nodejs or npm, or development tools such as make. This is because kbase-ui is built inside of a Docker build process, using build tools installed into a Docker image.\nIt is certainly possible to build kbase-ui locally on your host machine, and this is described in the Development documentation. However, for normal deployment and development, this should not be necessary.\ngit\ngit is used to fetch kbase-ui and any other repos that may be involved in a given development effort. Of course, if you are making source code changes it is a critical tool in the development process.\nMacOS\nOn MacOS, git is available through xCode, macports, brew, and an installer from git.\nApple xCode\nxCode may be installed from the Apple App Store for free, and is highly recommended for any developer workstation. Not only does it provide some of the required tools, but some macOS developer tools require xCode be installed.\nxCode includes both git and make, which are required for building kbase-ui, as well as a compilers which may be required to install other developer tools via installers from macports, npm, and the like.\nAlthough xCode includes git, make and other developer tools, you may also opt to install these or similar (e.g. gmake) tools separately.\nNative Package from git\nInstallation of native Mac packages should put you in good stead. Just follow the links below and instructions therein.\nhttp://git-scm.com/download/mac\nMacports\n1) Install Apple xCode\nxCode may be required by Macports to install certain packages (some are distributed as binary, some need to be compiled.)\nxCode is available for free from the App Store.\n2) Install Macports\nDownload and follow the instructions at https://www.macports.org/install.php.\n\nMacports will install its own binary path (/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin/) ahead of the path used by xCode (/usr/bin). You can change that in ~/.profile if you wish.\n\n2) Use the terminal to install the dependencies using Macports\nOpen Terminal and issue the following commands:\nsudo port install git\n\nNote: Although xCode installs git, the one available through macports is probably more up-to-date.\n\nLinux\nAs a Linux user, you should be familiar with the package management tools for the distribution you use. Without a version constraint, you should just install the most recent version available.\nE.g. for Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nWindows\n[ to be done ]\ndocker\n[ to be done ]\n"},"getting-started/local-dev-prerequisites.html":{"url":"getting-started/local-dev-prerequisites.html","title":"Developer Setup","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisites\nThe kbase-ui web app is used as a Docker image.

However, it is best to keep them always at the most recent version by updating your tool stack periodically\n\nkbase-ui is built not just on your local development workstation, but int the following places:\n\nin Travis CI, as part of the github workflow\nin the KBase Jenkins instance, as part of the CI deployment\nin a KBase VM (??) as part of the next/appdev/production deployment process\n\nAs such, we need to ensure that each part of the build toolchain is consistent in each environment. Thus, even though a different version of the above tools may work for you (and of course no-one is watching you to make sure you aren't!) please be advised that it is possible that you can introduce dependencies upon a version of a tool which will break in one of the other KBase build environments.\nnodejs\nNode and npm are used together to build kbase-ui and to run tests. Node and npm change very frequently, and the number of transitive dependencies involved in the build and test toolchain number in the thousands. Therefore, we must always be cautious when making changes to both the toolchain and dependencies.

In this document we provide instructions for installation on platforms in use at KBase using methods that we have employed and work.\nInstallation\nAll environments\nThe following tools are available on all supported platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux). Please consult the installation instructions at the respective web sites:\n\nDocker - https://www.docker.com\n\nThat leaves us with nodejs and git to install through other means.\nMacintosh\nThere are three common sources for these tools natively on a Mac:\n\nApple xCode\nNative Mac installation packages\nMacports\nHomebrew\n\n(see the Linux section for Vagrant on Mac instructions.)\nThe requisite development tools are available as regular Mac packages. This is may be the easiest way to get started. However, if you are going to be installing other Unixy tools, or have one of the following package managers installed, either Macports or Homebrew may be preferable, and are not much more difficult. Package managers also make updating your tools easy, whereas the downloadable packages will need to be periodically updated manually.\nApple xCode\nxCode may be installed from the Apple App Store for free, and is highly recommended for any developer workstation. Not only does it provide some of the required tools, but some macOS developer tools require xCode be installed.\nxCode includes both git and make, which are required for building kbase-ui, as well as a compilers which may be required to install other developer tools via installers from macports, npm, and the like.\nAlthough xCode includes git, make and other developer tools, you may also opt to install these or similar (e.g. gmake) tools separately.\nNative Packages\nInstallation of native Mac packages should put you in good stead. Just follow the links and instructions therein.\n1) Git\nGit may be installed directly from the git organization:\nhttp://git-scm.com/download/mac\nGit may also be installed as a command line tool component of Apple xCode, or independently via a Mac package manager like macports or brew, if you favor those.\nYou should simply install the most recent version available\n2) Nodejs\nnodejs may be installed from the canonical home:\nhttps://nodejs.org\nAs of this time, please use version 8 of NodeJS. We try to stay on the most recent LTS release, but the most important constraint is that we are using the same major version across all environments - local dev, travis, CI and next/appdev/prod.\n3) npm global packages\nIt is no longer recommended to install the global version of npm-based development tools. Rather, they run out of the local kbase-ui repo. The local repo always installs these tools, since they are used by the build and testing tools.\nFor convenience, you may run \n. tools/devtools.sh\n\nfrom a terminal window located at the kbase-ui repo directory to put the node executable directory into the current path.\n\nNote: yarn? Yes, we may be switching to yarn in the near future.\n\nMacports\n1) Install Apple xCode\nAs mentioned above, you should have already installed xCode â€” xCode is required by macports.\n2) Install macports\nDownload and follow the instructions at https://www.macports.org/install.php.\n\nMacports will install its own binary path (/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin/) ahead of the path used by xCode (/usr/bin). You can change that in ~/.profile if you wish.\n\n2) Use the terminal to install the dependencies using Macports\nopen Terminal and issue the following commands:\nsudo port install nodejs6 npm5 git\nNote that the version of nodejs is important. We try very hard to use the same version of nodejs in local development as KBase uses in build/deployment environments and as the Travis configuration uses. There are major changes between nodejs releases. Although a newer nodejs will be probably be able to run code written for an older version, the converse is not necessarily true, and it is certainly easy to start using features enabled by a newer node version if it is available. There may also be subtle differences in the building of dependencies through npm.\nIn general we try to stay on the most recent Long Term Support (LTS) of any dependency, but sometimes it takes us a while to have time to coordinate the concurrent update of all of the places they are used.\n\nNote: Although xCode installs git, the one available through macports is probably more up-to-date.\n\nHomebrew\n\nto be done\n\nWindows\n\nto be done\n\nLinux\nUbuntu\n\nto be done\n\n\nIndex - README - Release Notes - KBase\n\n"},"getting-started/quick-start.html":{"url":"getting-started/quick-start.html","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Quick Start\nThis guide should allow you to run kbase-ui on your host system.

A release notes is created for the next presumptive release, before the release is actually created. The release notes document is named RELEASE_NOTES_#.#.#.md where #.#.# is the version of the release. When a release notes document is created, it is also added to the index.md file in the same directory.\n\nNote: The release notes file is validated during the deployment process; the current release version number must match a release notes file.\n\nThe release notes document should begin with a summary of the changes, a section describing the nature of any major changes, and a section itemizing the changes, broken into the following sections: New, Unreleased, Improvements, Fixes\nEach item should, if possible, note the JIRA ticket id in the markdown link format ID.\nRelease Config\nA single config file defines the current release. This serves to tie the codebase to the current git tag. This file is located in config/release.yml. As part of the release process the property release.version must be set to the presumptive semver tag.\nUpdate Canonical Repo\nThe canonical kbase-ui repo, https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui, must be updated with these changes.\n\nNote: We do not tag the release yet!\n\nMerge to Master\nAt present we still use the \"develop/master\" dual branch model, so we always merge the develop branch to master before testing the release and ultimately tagging it with the version.\n\nNote: With the advent of tagged releases, this is no longer necessary because we can always create a hotfix branch from a tag if necessary in order to deal with out-of-band updates to production.\n\nTo do this, you should first attempt a pull request through the github ui. To do this, \n\nNavigate to https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\nClick the \"New Pull Request\" button\nSelect as base \"master\", as compare: \"develop\".\nIf there are no conflicts reported, create a title \"Develop -> Master\" and click \"Create Pull Request\"\n\nConflicts\nIf there are conflicts, it is best to perform the merge locally, resolve the issues, test the ui, and issue a pull request for the merge.\nConflicts may happen if much time has elapsed between releases and there have been hotfixes to the release which were not merged back into the develop branch.\nIt may be easiest to attempt a merge locally, identify the conflicts, and commit changes to the develop to prevent the conflicts, if possible.\nFirst get it and generate the conflicts:\nmkdir test-release\ncd test-release\ngit clone -b master https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\ncd kbase-ui\ngit merge origin/develop origin/master\n\nResolve the conflicts with your favorite tool. E.g.:\ncode .\n\nTest for prod:\nmake build-prod\nmake prod-image\nmake run-prod-image\n\nTest the Presumptive Release\nOnce the develop branch has been merged into the master branch, or even from the pull request, you should test the release.\nmkdir test-release\ncd test-release\ngit clone https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\ncd kbase-ui\ngit fetch origin pull/PULL#/head:test-PULL#\ngit checkout test-PULL#\n\nTesting a tag locally\nThis is necessary for local next/appdev/prod testing since the build will fail if there is no tag on the current commit.\ngit tag -a v1.5.0 -m \"1.5.0\"\nafter additional commits you'll need to delete the tag and the add it again\ngit tag -d v1.5.0\nBuilding image\ntag the repo\nBefore pulling down the image for building, it should have been tagged. In fact, the clone you are building from should have been pulled down by that tag.\nThe tag should be checked into the canonical repo, and the local clone based on that tag.\nFor local testing of the build, you can tag locally to simulate this.\nE.g. \ngit tag v1.5.0 -m \"1.5.0\"\nTo remove the tag\ngit tag --delete v1.5.0\nBuild kbase-ui\nThe makefile target \"build\" will build the kbase-ui files. The make target \"build-ci\" will also\nbuild a minified version of kbase-ui suitable for deployment.\nbuild the image\nThe makefile target \"dockerimage\" is a target shared with many KBase repos that build\ndocker deployment images. This makefile target requires that the \"build-ci\" makefile target has\nbeen run in order to generate the files that are to be published in the docker_image. Note that\nthe \"ci\" in \"build-ci\" is construed to mean build for continuous integration _in general rather\nthan build for the CI environment specifically.\nThe build process builds an image named kbase/kbase-ui:$TAG where $TAG is the current branch\nthat is checked out. If the branch is master, $TAG substitutes \"latest\" for master.\nThe Travis-CI environment performs builds of the master and develop branches, and pushes the new builds into\ndockerhub. It should not be necessary to modify docker images for different environments, aside from\npassing in difference values for the environment variables.\nIt should also not be necessary to retag a develop image as latest in order to promote it for release.\nThe image tagged with latest should automatically track the master branch of the repo.\nThe docker image is built to be suitable for development mode (serves up JS files un-minified)\nas well as in production ( serves up JS files minified as well as a minified archive of all the libraries).\nThe settings for running in CI, AppDev, Next and Prod KBase environments are handled via templates that\nare populated at runtime for each particular environment. The template files can be found in this directory\nunder the repository root: deployment/ci/docker/context/contents/conf\nThe templates are build for use with the docker tool and follow\nthe Golang text/template templating rules. At runtime the\ndockerize program is given environment variables as well as the templates that need to be rendered,\nand these determine the nginx configuration as well as the details of the content to be served. The\ndockerfile in deployment/ci/docker/context/Dockerfile shows the parameters passed to dockerize to\nconfigure the container.\nExamples of environment variables for each different deployment environment ( CI, AppDev, Next, Prod ) can\nbe found in deployment/conf/*.env\nThese files contain name/value pairs for environment variables that can be interpreted by either docker\nas an --env_file parameter, or as files that dockerize can directly read, via the dockerize --env\nparameter.\nFor the purposes of the config.json file, the key environment variable that determines the running environment\nis the \"deploy_environment\" variable, which is set to ci, appdev, next, prod as necessary. Another important\nvariable is the flag \"uncompress\", if this variable is set, then the nginx container will serve the uncompressed\nversions of the JS files. Leave uncompress undefined (not false or 0) to serve minified content.\nOther important environment variables are:\n\nnginx_listen - what port the nginx server should listen on. Note that the container only serves cleartext content. SSL should be handled by a separate proxy\nnginx_server_name - What server name should the nginx server present itself as?\nnginx_loglevel - what level of logging should be set in the nginx error log?\nnginx_syslog - enable syslogging of the nginx access and error logs\n\nAs a rule, when there are differences in images between dev, CI, AppDev and Prod, work the differences\ninto the template files or else have the differences enabled/disabled via environment variables or\nsome configuration file setting.\n"},"devops/disabling-menus.html":{"url":"devops/disabling-menus.html","title":"Disabling Menus","keywords":"","body":"Disabling Menus in a Deployment\nThe UI menus consist of the hamburger and the sidebar.\nThe menus are defined by individual plugins. The definition includes an id, label, icon, a flag indicating whether it appears only when the session is logged in, and a flag indicating if the menu item is disabled.\nA menu item does not appear just because it is defined. The ui itself possesses a set of configuration files defining the items appearing on a menu. These files are located at\n\nconfig/app/dev/services\nconfig/app/ci/services\nconfig/app/prod/services\n\nThe menu settings are set on the ui/services/menu config branch, as they menu is managed by the \"menu\" ui service.\nThe menu settings are determined at build time during the config merge phase, at which time the various config files are merged and written to ROOT/modules/config/config.json\nThe deployment config resides in ROOT/modules/deploy/config.json.\nIt contains a property ui.services.menu which contains a structure like this:\n            \"menu\": {\n                \"menus\": {\n                    \"hamburger\": {\n                        \"disabled\": []\n                    },\n                    \"sidebar\": {\n                        \"disabled\": [\"search\"]\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\nThe menus.sidebar.disabled and menus.hamburger.disabled properties each contain an array of menu ids to disable.

Developer tools support this simple directory layout.\nWe'll just call this directory ~/work/project, but you can of course place it wherever you like and name it whatever pleases you.\nmkdir -p ~/work/project\ncd ~/work/project\n\nInstall a local copy of kbase-ui\nDevelopment workflows for kbase-ui typically starting from the tip of the develop branch of the kbase-ui repo in kbase github account. You will therefore be pushing changes to your fork of kbase/kbase-ui.\nIf you have your own preferred method of setting up a repo for this type of workflow, please use it. Here is one setup that I use:\ngit clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\ncd kbase-ui\ngit remote set-url --push origin no-push\ngit remote add NICKNAME ssh://git@github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui\ngit checkout -b BRANCHNAME\ngit push NICKNAME BRANCHNAME\n\nWith this flow, you are operating in the branch BRANCHNAME, which started at the tip of the develop branch in the main kbase/kbase-ui repo. You will push it to your fork located at the github account YOURACCOUNT, which has been set up at remote NICKNAME in the local git configuration.\n\nNote: this setup requires that you have generated an ssh key on your machine, and installed it in your giithub account.\n\nInstall custom Docker network\nIn order for the proxier to access the kbase-ui container, or for more advanced workflows involving locally hosted services or service mocks, we need to establish a local custom network for Docker. It can be named anything you like, as long as it is consistent across images. We choose the name kbase-dev.\ndocker network create kbase-dev\n\nBuild and run kbase-ui\nThis will fetch, prepare, build, create the image, and run a container from that image. \nmake init\nmake build config=dev\nmake image build=build\nmake run-image env=dev\n\nWhere:\n\nmake init installs all of the build and testing tools and libraries not already covered by the prerequisites\nmake build config=dev runs the developer build of kbase-ui (defaults to prod build)\nmake image build=build builds a Docker image containing the dev build of the ui (defaults to the prod \"dist\" build)\nmake run-image env=dev runs the Docker image with the dev environment (defaults to the \"prod\" environment)\n\n\nTip: \nOn macOS and Linux/Unix you may want to use the aliaas shell command to create your own shortcuts. E.g. \nalias buildui=\"make build config=dev;make image build=build\"\n\nwill make the shell command buildui available in your shell. See tools/devtools.sh\n\nPrepare and run the Proxier\nThe proxier is a small Docker image which runs nginx to proxy requests for a given KBase deployment hostname (e.g. ci.kbase.us) to a local kbase-ui Docker container, with other requests routed to the canonical locations within KBase. \nmake proxier-image\nmake run-proxier-image env=dev\n\nWhere\n\nmake proxier-image builds the proxier Docker image\nmake run-proxier-image env=dev will start a container running this image, using the dev environment. The dev env is the default, so you may omit this.\n\n\nNote: A shortcut for make run-proxies-image env=dev, runui, is provided in tools/devtools.sh\n\nThe dev env responses to ci.kbase.us.\nMap ci.kbase.us to your local host\nIn order for your browser to use the proxier for requests to ci.kbase.us, you need to add a line to your /etc/hosts (or equivalent, if on Windows). \n127.0.0.1  ci.kbase.us\n\nIn fact, you may find it handy to add this entire section to your /etc/hosts, and comment in the environment you are currently working on:\n127.0.0.1    ci.kbase.us\n#127.0.0.1    appdev.kbase.us\n#127.0.0.1    next.kbase.us\n#127.0.0.1    kbase.us narrative.kbase.us\nBring up the local kbase-ui\nBring up your browser to https://ci.kbase.us.\nYou'll receive a security warning due to the usage of a self-signed ssl certificate inside the container. Just go through the hoops to accept it. Each browser is different.\n\nTip: Browsers can be VERY finicky with self signed certs, especially if you have change the self signed cert, which may happen when you rebuild the proxier image.\n\nStop it\nWhen you are finished you will want to stop the container, simpley press Ctrl+ C. The container should immediately stop. \nYou may also use your favorite docker management tool, such as Kitematic on macOS.\nMore\nDocker Tips - a collection of handy docker commands\nNext Steps\n\nDeveloping a Plugin\nCreating a External Plugin\n\n\nIndex - README - Release Notes - KBase\n\n"},"development/developing-a-plugin.html":{"url":"development/developing-a-plugin.html","title":"Updating an Exiting Plugin","keywords":"","body":"Developing kbase-ui Plugins\nThis guide describes a workflow for working on kbase-ui plugins, and deploying plugin and kbase-ui updates.\nBecause the creation of a plugin involves a set of one-time tasks, it is described in a separate document Creating a New Plugin.\n[TOC]\nPrerequisites\nThis guide does not cover setting up kbase-ui for development -- if you have not done that yet please see the following documents:\n\nPrerequisites\nGetting Started\n\nSetting Up\nGood, now that you have set up a kbase-ui development environment, it is time to integrate a plugin to work on.\nFork the Plugin Repo\nIf you haven't yet, now is the time to fork the plugin repo at github.\nAll kbase plugins have an upstream repo in the kbase github account at https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-THEPLUGIN.\nWhere THEPLUGIN is the name of the plugin.\n\nWell, sometimes during initial development, a plugin may reside at your personal repo. This saves the extra pull request step which can slow down iterative development, especially when a plugin is being born. This only works well when you are the sole developer\n\nNote that all plugin repos are prefixed with kbase-ui-plugin-. This is not a hard requirement, in that kbase-ui can use plugins named otherwise. However kbase-ui build tools assume this naming convention, and it is good practice for a few reasons:\n\nit creates a uniqe name in the github namespace\nit createsa a unique name in the bower namespace (more on that later)\nit makes it easier to manage plugins in your project (they appear together in directory listings)\n\nWhen we reference the name of a plugin, we always refer the the string occuring after the kbase-ui-plugin- prefix.\nSo, your task is to fork the repo you are interested in.\n\ncreate a github account if you do not already have one\nsign in to github if you are not already and ensure you are using the correct account for kbase work\nvisit the github page for the plugin\nthe root page for all plugins is https://github.com/kbase\n\n\nfork the repo into your github account using the fork button\n\nClone the Plugin Repo\nWe'll clone the plugin repo using the same method used for setting up kbase-ui for development.\nFirst, open a terminal in the top level project directory you set up (in Getting Started) to contain the kbase-ui repo.\nThen we'll clone the canonical plugin repo in the kbase account.\n$ cd ~/work/project\n$ git clone https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n\nThen ensure that you can't accidentally merge changes back into the kbase repo:\n$ cd kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n$ git remote set-url --push origin no-push\n\n\nYou probably don't have push access to the repo, but this is a good practice\n\nThen add a remote which is your fork of the repo.\n$ git remote add NICKNAME https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n\nThis sets up a remote named NICKNAME which points to your fork using the https method.\nIf you want to avoid the need to enter your password every time you push changes back up to your account, you may want to set up an ssh key:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh.\nIf you have an ssh key for your current machine established for your github account, the clone command would look like\n$ git remote add NICKNAME ssh://git@github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n In either event, you have now established the plugin as a sister directory to kbase-ui. Your development directory should now look like:\n project\n    kbase-ui\n    kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\nBuild and run the image with the plugin linked\nA tool is provided to both run the kbase-ui image (container) and at the same time link the local plugin directly into the image. Once you have done this, changes made to the local plugin will be relfected immediately in kbase-ui (after a browser reload.)\nThis works by mounting the plugin source directory to the corresponding location inside of the kbase-ui container. The docker-mounted directory will temporarily replace the directory which was installed when kbase-ui was built.\ncd ~/work/project/kbase-ui\nmake build config=dev\nmake image build=build\nmake run-image env=dev plugins=PLUGINNAME\n\nYou should see a successful startup of the docker container, with several log lines printed into the console, and at the end\n:)\n\nAbout linking plugins into the container\nThese build steps above are are covered in Getting Started and About Building.\nWhat is new is the plugins option to make run-image.\nThis option tells the run-image task to mount the plugin directory matching the plugin name into the kbase-ui image.\nLet me explain:\nRemember, if we have set up the project directory in the pattern described above, the plugin directory indicated by PLUGINNAME is located one directory above kbase-ui, and named \"kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\".\nInside the plugin the directory structure is uniform. The directory path kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME/src/plugin is the root of the plugin source code. When kbase-ui is built, this directory is copied direct to kbase-ui/build/build/client/modules/plugins/PLUGINNAME. When the kbase-ui image is built, the plugin code lives at /kb/deployment/services/kbase-ui/modules/plugins/PLUGINNAME\n\n See About Building for an explanation of the build process and structure.\n\nThe important point is that the plugins option will tell Docker to mount your plugin repo src/plugin directory into the kbase-ui image at the location described above.\nOnce this mapping has been done, any changes you make to the plugin are \"live\" inside the kbase-ui docker container. A simple refresh of the browser will load any changes.\nConfirm that this works by pulling up your favorite browser to https://ci.kbase.us.\n\nAssuming, that is, that your /etc/hosts still points to your local kbase-ui container!\n\nDevelop!\nYou may now make changes to the plugin, and see those changes reflected immediately upon refreshing the browser.\nThis is the essential plugin workflow\nNext Topics\nThe next view sections will cover the following topics:\n\nTesting\nReleasing\nMerging into kbase-ui \"for reals\"\nDeploying into CI\nAdditional Topics\nDebugging Tips\nsupported kbase-ui dependencies\nWhat? You need a new dependency?\n\n\n\nTesting\nWe don't currently have a formal test harness for automated testing of plugins, so all of your testing will be by hand. Nevertheless, you do have the ability to manually verify that your plugin works against all kbase environments.\n\nMaybe we should rather call this \"verification\"\n\nThere are three basic levels of testing, each more onerous than the previous.\n\nDev mode testing - use the kbase-ui dev build, with local plugin changes mounted into the image\nDev build testing - use the kbase-ui dev build with local plugin changes checked in and released\nProd build testing - use the kbase-ui prod build with local plugin changes released\n\nManual Testing Process\nFor each environment (dev, ci, next, appdev, prod), do the following:\n\nstart the kbase-ui container for that environment\n\nmake run-image env=ENV\n\n\nwhere ENV is each of dev, ci, next, appdev, prod\n\n\n\nstart the proxier for the matching environment\n\nmake run-proxier-image env=ENV\n\n\nnote that this ENV must match the first one\n\n\n\nPerform your tests\n\n\nThese steps are identical for each of the testing modes\nDev Mode Testing\nThis is essentially an extension of the normal edit & reload process, with the twist that you should check all top features of the plugin for regression, and check against all deployment environments. \nYou should perform this testing before releasing your plugin changes.\nDev Build Testing\nIn this test mode, you have check in, merged, and released the plugin changes (because they passed the Dev Mode Testing above). You will have updated kbase-ui with the new plugin version, and rebuilt kbase-ui (as described in Preparing for Release.)\n\npush your code up to your repo\nissue a PR for the plugin\neither merge the PR yourself, or request a review and merge\ncreate a semver tag for the kbase plugin repo\nupdate the kbase-ui build files with the new semver:\nconfig/app/dev/plugins.yml\nconfig/app/prod/plugins.yml\n\n\n\nYou should perform this testing before a kbase-ui Pull Request which integrates your updated plugin.\nIf you feel confident in your changes, or they are trivial, you may skip this step and continue to Prod BuildTesting.\nProd Build Testing\nFinally, before issuing a PR for integrating your updated plugin into kbase-ui, you need to perform testing using the production build. This should be done sparingly, and usually just as a pre-release task, because the prod build can take several minutes. Fortunately, once the build is finished the same as above.\nIn addition to the tasks for Dev Build Testing:\n\nmake the prod build \nmake the image using the prod build\n\nThen perform your tests against each environment as described above.\nFuture Testing Plans\nFirst, there is nascent support for selenium-based integration testing in kbase-ui. Thus you can perform ad-hoc automated integration testing if you set up the tests by hand. We do not have this testing integrated into Travis or Jenkins, nor a method for integration of plugin tests into the kbase-ui testing apparatus.\nSee Testing for more.\nDeploying updated plugin\nWhen you have completed a round of changes to the plugin and it is ready for review on CI, you will need to update the plugin repo and issue the changes into the CI environment. Typically this will involve two sets of updates -- first a PR for your plugin changes, which results in a new version; secondly a PR for the new plugin version in kbase-ui, which will result in a new release in CI.\n\ncommit all changes\npush changes to your fork\nissue a PR for the kbase plugin\nafter the PR is accepted, a new version will have been issued\nupdate the plugin version in your kbase-ui plugins.yml config for both dev and ci (and prod if this is ready for release)\nrebuild kbase-ui and verify that the build works, and that the changes are present\ncommit and push your kbase-ui changes (which will just be configuration changes to bump up the version for your plugin) to your kbase-ui fork\nissue a PR for this change\nthe PR will be accepted and kbase-ui will be redeployed into CI\n\n\nIf the PR is in the early stages, it may still be in your personal github account; if this is so clearly you can skip the PR process for the plugin, and issue the new release version yourself. Don't worry â€”  when you transfer the repo to the kbase account, all commits and release tags are retained.\n\nNext Steps\n\nCreating a New Plugin\n\n\nIndex - README - Release Notes - KBase\n\n"},"development/developing-internal-plugins.html":{"url":"development/developing-internal-plugins.html","title":"Working on an Internal Plugin","keywords":"","body":"Developing kbase-ui Plugins\nThis guide covers a developer workflow for developing kbase-ui plugins, and deploying plugin and kbase-ui updates.\n\nNote this is for working on an existing plugin -- it does not cover creation of a plugin from scratch\n\n\nPrerequisites\nSetting Up\nLinking into kbase-ui\nDeploying updated plugin\nIntegrating into kbase-ui\nDeploying updated kbase-ui\n\nPrerequisites\nThis guide does not cover setting up kbase-ui for development -- if you have not done that yet please see the following documents:\n(1) prerequisites.md\n(2) developing-kbase-ui.md\nSetting Up\nGood, now that you have set up a kbase-ui development environment, it is time to integrate a plugin to work on.\nFork the Plugin Repo\nIf you haven't yet, now is the time to fork the plugin repo at github.\nAll kbase plugins have an upstream repo in the kbase github account at https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-THEPLUGIN.\nWhere THEPLUGIN is the name of the plugin.\n\nNote that sometimes during initial rapid development, a plugin may reside at your personal repo. This saves the extra pull request step which can slow down iterative development. This only works well when you are the sole developer\n\nNote that all plugin repos are prefixed with kbase-ui-plugin-. This is not strictly a requirement, although some kbase-ui build tools will assume this, but it is good practice for a few reasons:\n\nit creates a uniqe name in the github namespace\nit createsa a unique name in the bower namespace (more on that later)\nit makes it easier to manage plugins in your project (they appear together in directory listings)\n\nWhen we reference the name of a plugin, we always refer the the string occuring after the kbase-ui-plugin- prefix.\nSo, your task is to fork the repo you are interested in.\n\ncreate a github account if you do not already have one\nif you are a kbase staff member and you already have a github account, you may wish to create a kbase account distinct from your other identity on github\n\n\nsign in to github if you are not already and ensure you are using the correct account for kbase work\nvisit the github page for the plugin\nthe root page for all plugins is https://github.com/kbase\n\n\nfork the repo into your github account using the fork button\n\nClone the Plugin Repo\nWe'll clone the plugin repo using the same method used for setting up kbase-ui for development.\nFirst, open a terminal in the top level dev directory you set up to contain the kbase-ui repo.\nThen we'll clone the canonical plugin repo in the kbase account.\n$ git clone https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n\nThen add a remote which is your fork of the repo.\n$ git remote add NICKNAME https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n\nThis sets up a remote named NICKNAME which points to your fork using the https method.\nIf you want to avoid the need to enter your password every time you push changes back up to your account, you may want to set up an ssh key:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/.\nIf you have an ssh key for your current machine established for your github account, the clone command would look like\n$ git remote add NICKNAME ssh://git@github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n In either event, you have now established the plugin as a sister directory to kbase-ui. Your development directory should now look like:\n dev\n    kbase-ui\n        ...\n    kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n        ...\nAn aside: how plugins are built into kbase-ui\nIn the kbase-ui build configuration, there exists a configuration file listing all of the plugins to be built into the kbase-ui web app. This configuration file specifies the plugin name, the location and the version. \nThe entry will look like this:\n    -\n        name: PLUGINNAME\n        globalName: kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME\n        version: 1.2.3\n        cwd: src/plugin\n        source:\n            bower: {}\nDuring the kbase-ui build process, the build tool uses the bower package manager to locate and download the correct version of the plugin source from github and install it locally. The build tool then copies the src/plugin/modules directory into the kbase-ui modules/plugins directory, and uses the src/plugin/config.yml file to integrate plugin components into the ui.\nNow, you may be able to see that one way to develop plugins is to simply update the plugin source, merge it into the repo, update the repo version, and rebuild kbase-ui. That is the short version of the steps necessary to integrate a plugin change! Although these steps are necessary for a well-managed system, it would be a  slow way to incrementally develop a plugin (although you can imagine a set of tools to automate it.)\nSo, at develop-time, an alternative method is used. Since during the kbase-ui build process the plugin src/plugin/module directory is simply copied, whole-cloth, into the kbase-ui built source tree, we can simply alter the kbase-ui build to point to our local src/plugin/module rather than the installed one.\nIn the old development workflows, the installed plugin would be removed and the local development directory linked into the build. In the current docker-based workflow, we use the docker run mount options to perform a similar function. Fortunately this is wrapped within the 'run-image.sh' tool \nRun the image with the plugin linked\nA tool is provided to both run the image (container) and at the same time link the locally cloned plugin directly into the image. This works by mounting the plugin source directory to the corresponding location inside of the kbase-ui container. The docker-mounted directory will temporarily replace the directory which was installed when kbase-ui was built.\ncd ~/work/dev/kbase-ui\nbash deployment/dev/tools/run-image.sh dev -p MYPLUGIN\n\nThe tool we are running is `run-image.sh. \nHere is the usage output:\nUsage: run-image.sh env [-p external-plugin] [-i internal-plugin] [-l lib-module-dir:lib-name:source-path]'\n\nYou should see a successful startup of the docker container, with log lines printed into the console.\nenv argument\nThe first argument to run-image is the `env. This value corresponds to the corresponding deployment config file located in deployment/conf. Since we are supplying \"dev\", we will be using the deploy file \"deployment/conf/dev.ini\".\n-p argument\nWe are using the -p argument to specify an external plugin to link into the kbase-ui image. Note that we use the plugin name, not the repo name. The tool knows how to find the plugin directory based on the directory structure (it should be a sister directory to kbase-ui) and uniform naming structure for repos (kbase-ui-plugin-PLUGINNAME).\n\nTODO: provide a make task for this\n\nConfirm that this works by pulling up your favorite browser to https://ci.kbase.us.\nDevelop!\nYou may now make changes to the plugin, and see those changes reflected immediately upon refreshing the browser.\nMore sections to be written for external plugin development\n\ntesting changes for all environments\npr, merge, tagging plugin\nlocal testing again with new version\npr, merge ui changes (just config)\nredeploy on CI\n\n UPDATED \nDeploying updated plugin\n[ to be done ]\n[ this section will describe how to get your updated plugin back into the home repo and to increment the version]\nUpdating your repo\nThe pull request\nThe version bump\nIntegrating into  kbase-ui\n[ to be done]\n[ with an updated plugin, time to integrate it back into kbase-ui and ensure it works ]\nUpdating plugins configurations\nTest each build\nDeploying updated kbase-ui\n[ to be done ]\n[ with an updated kbase ui, time to get that back into the home repo and up on ci ]\nCommit changes and push up to your fork\nPull Request to the main repo\nTesting your PR\nTesting the PR can take place alongside the development stuff, taking advantage of the vm and proxy that are already set up.\nAll this should be done in the vm, so open up a terminal in the vm if you don't have one already.\nvagrant ssh\nEnsure that the vm has the required kbase-ui dev dependencies:\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs git\nSet up testing directory and clone repos\nIn the /vagrant directory, create a directory pr-testing\ncd /vagrant\nmkdir pr-testing\nIn this directory, clone the plugin and kbase-ui from the kbase account at github:\ngit clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\ngit clone https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-MYPLUGIN\nIn the plugin directory fetch the pull request 123 into a branch:\ngit fetch origin pull/123/head:test-123\ngit checkout test-123\nSet up kbase-ui to use a local plugin directory\nConfigure the build to use the local plugin for the build\ncd kbase-ui\nvi config/ui/ci/build.yml\nin the section for the plugin change the source:\n    -\n        name: dataview\n        globalName: kbase-ui-plugin-dataview\n        version: 3.1.6\n        cwd: src/plugin\n        source:\n            bower: {}\nto this\n    -\n        name: dataview\n        globalName: kbase-ui-plugin-dataview\n        version: 3.1.6\n        cwd: src/plugin\n        source:\n            directory: {}\n\nNote: be sure to preserve spaces and not use tabs; otherwise you will get a yaml error during the build\n\nBuild kbase-ui\nmake init\nmake build config=ci\nDeveloper build for working on external plugins\nThe setup for working on external plugins is very similar to that of working on kbase-ui, except that you must clone the plugins and instruct the image runner to mount the plugins.\nThe short list:\n\ncreate top level working directory\nwithin this directory clone kbase-ui and any plugins you want to work on\nkbase-ui needs to start out in develop branch of kbase/kbase-ui\nplugins only have a master branch\n\n\nbuild kbase-ui\nbuild the kbase-ui dev image\nconfigure your /etc/hosts to use the dev server\nrun the image with the plugins linked in:\n\nCreate Top Level Working Directory\nThe kbase-ui tools assume that kbase-ui is cloned alonside any plugins or libraries which are linked into it. Therefore, you need to create a single working directory and clone the repos inside of it.\nLet's assume this is ~/work/dev, or just dev for short.\nClone kbase-ui and any plugins\ncd ~/work/dev\ngit clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui\ngit clone https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-my-plugin\n\nYou'll need a PR friendly git clone setup. There are several ways to do this. Using the above as a starting point, for instance:\ncd ~/work/dev/kbase-ui\ngit checkout -b \ngit remote add  ssh://git@github.com//kbase-ui\ncd ~/work/dev/kbase-ui-plugin-my-plugin\ngit checkout -b \ngit remote add  ssh://git@github.com//kbase-ui-plugin-my-plugin\n\nThis will add your fork of kbase-ui under the remote name . Note that it is using ssh transport, which will your ssh key registered at github. If you don't work with ssh keys, you would just use the normal https form:\ngit remote add  https://githiub.com//kbase-ui\n\nOf course this assumes you have forked kbase-ui!\nYou would be working in the new local branch named , which started at the tip of the develop branch. You would then push your changes up to your fork like\ncd ~/work/dev\ngit push \n\nWorking with the plugin is similar, except your branch starts at the tip of the master branch.\nOf course, your workflow may be completely different, this is just an example.\n\nIndex - README - Release Notes - KBase\n\n"},"development/developing-alongside-narrative.html":{"url":"development/developing-alongside-narrative.html","title":"Working with the Narrative","keywords":"","body":"Developing Alongside the Narrative\nJust as it is easy to develop ui plugins, libraries, and internal components with a running kbase-ui instance, against any kbase deployment environment, it is also easy to use this same setup to work on certain aspects of the Narrative, particularly the UI.\nPrerequisites\n\nPrerequisites\nDeveloper Setup\n\nInstallation\nYou should already have set up a working directory, in to which is installed kbase-ui and kbase-ui-proxier.
