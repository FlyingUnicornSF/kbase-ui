# Getting Started

This document describes how to get set up for kbase-ui development.

## Prerequisites

- [Prerequisites](../getting-started/prerequisites.md)
- [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md)

## Introduction

If you have followed the [Prerequisites](../getting-started/prerequisites.md) and [Quick Start](../getting-started/quick-start.md) documents, you will have all the setup you need to get started.

To support development of kbase-ui itself, plugins, libraries, and local or dynamic services, several tools and techniques are available. The gist of these is:

- proxying all requests to the ui, which allows kbase-ui to work seamlessley as if it were installed in any given kbase deployment environment;
- mounting local directories into the kbase-ui container, allowing kbase-ui served inside the container to utilize files being edited locally

## Workflow

A typical work flow involves:

1. create working folder
2. checkout and setup repos you'll be working on
3. map ci.kbase.us host 
4. start up kbase-ui
5. stop kbase-ui
6. unmap ci.kbase.us host

### 1. Create Working Folder

In this and all developer documentation, it is assumed that all repos are installed under a single root working directory. Developer tools support this simple directory layout.

We'll just call this directory *~/work/project*, but you can of course place it wherever you like and name it whatever pleases you.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/work/project
cd ~/work/project
```

### 2. Checkout and Setup Repos

Within the project directory created above, you will need to clone kbase-ui as well as any other plugin or library repo you will be working on.

The directory structure will resemble:

```
project
  kbase-ui
  kbase-ui-plugin-MYPLUGIN
  kbase-MYLIBRARY
```

#### Install a local copy of kbase-ui

Development workflows for kbase-ui typically starting from the tip of the develop branch of the kbase-ui repo in kbase github account. You will therefore be pushing changes to your fork of kbase/kbase-ui.

If you have your own preferred method of setting up a repo for this type of workflow, please use it. Here is one setup that I use:

```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui
cd kbase-ui
git remote set-url --push origin no-push
git remote add NICKNAME ssh://git@github.com/YOURACCOUNT/kbase-ui
git checkout -b BRANCHNAME
git push NICKNAME BRANCHNAME
```

With this flow, you are operating in the branch *BRANCHNAME*, which started at the tip of the *develop* branch in the main *kbase/kbase-ui* repo. You will push it to your fork located at the github account *YOURACCOUNT*, which has been set up at remote *NICKNAME* in the local git configuration.

> Note: this setup requires that you have generated an ssh key on your machine, and installed it in your giithub account.

#### Install local copies of each other repo

In the same working directory clone each plugin or library you will be working on, using your preferred method.


### 3. Map ci.kbase.us to your local host

In order for your browser to use the kbase-ui proxy for requests to ci.kbase.us, you need to add a line to your `/etc/hosts` (or equivalent, if on Windows). 

```hosts
127.0.0.1  ci.kbase.us
```

In fact, you may find it handy to add this entire section to your /etc/hosts, and comment in the environment you are currently working on:

```
127.0.0.1	ci.kbase.us
#127.0.0.1	appdev.kbase.us
#127.0.0.1	next.kbase.us
#127.0.0.1	kbase.us narrative.kbase.us
```

### 4. Start kbase-ui

The local development workflow hinges on using Docker Compose to build and start both kbase-ui and the kbase-ui local proxy containers. Docker Compose simplifies configuration, as it is completely contained within `dev/docker-compose.yml` and `dev/docker-compose.override.yml`, and uses a simple set of docker-compose commands for all operations.

If you are familiar with the previous incarnation of kbase-ui workflow, which relied upon direct usage of `docker`, this new workflow is simpler and more reliable.

> However, it is new, so some workflows are not captured yet by the tools

The general form of the dev-start tool is:

```
make docker-compose-up [build=BUILD] [env=ENV] [plugins="P1 P2"] [internal="I2 I2" [libraries="L1 L2"] [paths="T1 T2"]
```

The most dead simple version is:

```
make dev-start
```

which simply starts up kbase-ui against CI, using the development build.

In order to incorporate a plugin cloned in the project directory, us this form

```
make dev-start plugins="MYPLUGIN"
```

For details on usage, see [Developer Tools](tools.md).

### 5. Stop kbase-ui

When you are finished with a work session, or for whatever reason wish to stop the kbase-ui and proxy containers:

- Press `Control` + `C` in the window in which the docker-compose-up tool was run.
    This should exit the tool, and hopefully stop the containers. 
- run `make dev-stop` 
    We do this to stop and remove any started containers, as well as to remove the custom kbase-dev network created by `make dev-start`

## 6. unmap ci.kbase.us

This is optional, but unless you are continuing to work on local kbase-ui, you should remove the /etc/hosts mapping in order to gain access to the "real" ci.kbase.us.

I prefer to simply comment out the line.
