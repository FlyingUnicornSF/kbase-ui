# Legacy Deployment Configs

This directory contains the deploy config files located at /kb/deployment/services/kbase-ui/modules/deploy/config.json for each of the KBase deployments.

The names are changed from config.json to {env}.json where {env} is the deploy environment ci, next, appdev, prod.

These files were generated by dockerize by the application of the corresponding environemnt file located in config/deploy/{env}.env to the template file deployment/ci/docker/kb-deployment/conf/config.json.tmpl

At present kbase-ui deployments still rely upon mounting the json config file into the container rather than running the container with dockerize and the corresponding environment file.
